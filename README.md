### Description

This is a simple "To do list" that I have created while learning to code with YouCode team.
First version of my "TO do list" was without buttons that I now added to finish all tasks and to hide tasks that
are already finished.

#### Technologies used:
- HTML
- Javasscript (ES6+)
- CSS
- BEM
